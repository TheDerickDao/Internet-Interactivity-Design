						Lee SeungHyun, born December 12, 1990, or better known as Seungri is the main dancer and the lead vocals for Big Bang. He was
						born in Gwangju, South Korea and at a young age, he realised he wanted to be a singer and watched a Britney Spears and N Sync
						join concert on TV. He claims that if it was not for music that shapes who he is now, he would be a kindergarten teacher. As the
						youngest member of Big Bang, he has the least space to hang his clothes in the preparation room.

						Prior to joining the group, back in Gwangju, he was the leader of the dance group "Il Hwa". He first appeared on television on the reality TV series Let's Cokeplay:
						Mnet Battle Shinhwa, a show in which Shinhwa attempted to create a boy band that could be a "second Shinhwa". Due to his lack of vocal skills, this led him
						to being eliminated from the band. If he had not been eliminated, he would have debuted in "Battle" a group of 6 boys that each Shinhwa member had selected.
						He was later scouted by YG Entertainment and joined the group Big Bang. Although he was initially cut from the series, he was given another chance to impress
						YG Entertainment CEO Yang Hyun Suk and succeeded. Back when he was part of his dance group in his hometown, he would compete against his fellow band member Taeyang
						in several dance competitions as well as Super Junior's Eunhyuk, TVXQ's Yunho and Shinee's Taemin. During Big Bang Documentary, for the battle between 2 teams, his
						team consisted of Taeyang, T.O.P. and were up against G-Dragon, Daesung and Hyunseung. Seungri was the leader of this group due to his dance skills. With an outstanding
						performance and clothing they had worn, they won the dance battle.

						alongside bandmate Daesung in 2009 "Shouting", who was unable to perform due to a car accident. Although his first solo song "Next Day" was recorded as part of Big Bang's album,
						his second song "Strong Baby" was released as a promotional single for the group's full-length album Remember. In order to get rid of the "youngest member" look from Big Bang,
						Seungri promoted the single with a more mature look along with a stylized dance. He won his first triple crown fro "Strong Baby" on Inkigayo.
