					Born in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, has been interested in music since hearing Brian McKnight's first album when
					he was younger. He is known to be extremely shy and nervous around girls; he had become more sociable with them
					but still unable to speak or look directly at them. One of his favourite songs is Don't Wanna Try by Frankie J.
					Taeyang always carries around his iPod, a bible, English vocabulary cards in his bag and sometimes along with energy drinks.
					Taeyang was a child actor in 5th grade and was recruited to play a part in JinuSean's MV "A-yo". This collaboration
					eventually lead him to a successful audition into the group's record label YG Entertainment, where he met band member G-Dragon,
					and former trainee Jun K. Taeyang was scehdules to debut alongside G-Dragon as a duo but the plan was scrapped by their
					record label and instead, were joined by four other trainees: T.O.P., Daesung, Seungri and Hyun-Seng to form Big Bang.

					Teddy and Kush. Taeyang had won quite a compliment for the song and later, his band member G-Dragon recorded a "part 2" version to the song. The second single released
					was "Prayer" which featured Teddy from 1TYM. In support for his album, he also staged his first solo concert, Hot. Later on, he received two accomplishments from the
